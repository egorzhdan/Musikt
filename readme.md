# Musikt â€“ Apple Music API for Kotlin

```
// Retrieve an artist by ID:
val a = AppleMusic.getArtist("178834")    // returns an Artist instance
println(a.name)                           // prints "Bruce Springsteen"
println(a.genreNames.joinToString())      // prints "Rock"
val b = a.albums                          // list of references to albums
val c = b.first().fetch()                 // loads and returns an Album

// Retrieve an album by ID:
val a = AppleMusic.getAlbum("310730204")  // returns an Album instance
print(a.name)                             // prints "Born to Run"
print(a.artistName)                       // prints "Bruce Springsteen"
print(a.editorialNotes?.short)
```

Musikt utilizes Kotlin coroutines to retrieve data from the API asynchronously without using callbacks/futures/rx.
All the functions requesting external resources are suspending.

## Getting started

In order to use the Apple Music API, you need to generate a private key on the Apple Developer website.

Before your application starts making requests to the API, set up your Team ID and private key:
```
Credentials.teamID = "team"
Credentials.privateKey = "key"
```
